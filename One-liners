# This document will describe a series of one-liners that are incredibly useful and that I always forget

# FASTA handling:

##Change the fasta headers inside a multifasta to (in this case) ">changeme1, >changeme2...."
awk '/^>/{print ">changeme_" ++i; next}{print}' < test


# MISC:

## Erase the header of a file and keep going until you find "  ". Then keep going until you hit line number -A
